Within this speech, President Kennedy also said \u201cThe growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment, by new techniques of learning and mapping and observation, by new tools and computers for industry, medicine, the home as well as the school. Technical institutions, such as Rice, will reap the harvest of these gains,\u201d. Today, education gives forth STEM to help the students of today, follow in the footsteps of their grandfathers. Through the learning of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, like those who touched the heavens, the generation of tomorrow might one day take humanity somewhere yet to feel the human touch. </p> <p>Grains of curiosity and dreams, sprinkled among the seeds of STEM, are cultivated by both teachers and professors. </p> <p>To aid the growth of these grains, the mission of Team 202 is to take S.T.E.M concepts found in education and deliver them in a manner students would understand. </p> <p>Team 202 will design a mechanical device to show scientific principles of energy conversion between different states, that also highlights the use of technology and engineering. Our goal is to add more seeds of curiosity and try to inspire more students to pursue more STEM related jobs. </p> <p>To achieve our task, Team 202 got together to discuss end goals for the project, deciding on a device that can task driven or function autonomously. By doing this, Team 202 can also develop our own skills in engineering and robotics, increasing our effectiveness as engineers. The team will assign roles to operate more smoothly, each member will practice effective communication through various means and be accountable for the task they are given</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"BdPdMS/","title":"Block Diagram, Process Diagram, and Message Structure","text":""},{"location":"BdPdMS/#block-diagram","title":"Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"BdPdMS/#process-diagram","title":"Process Diagram","text":""},{"location":"BdPdMS/#message-structure","title":"Message Structure","text":"Message Type  byte 1-2  (char) Description 1 Set motor X in Y in direction 2 Print sensor X value Y 3 Subsystem Wifi Error Message 4 Subsystem Wifi Status X 5 Subsystem X is not communicating 6 Motor Status, X 7 Sensor Status, X"},{"location":"BdPdMS/#message-type-1","title":"Message Type 1:","text":"Byte 1 (char) Byte 2 (char) Byte 3 (char) Byte 4 (char) Byte 5-6 (char) Byte 7 (char) Byte 8 (char) Byte 9 (char) Byte 10 (char) A Z Source ID (char) Dest ID (char) Message Type (char) X(char) Y(char) B Y"},{"location":"BdPdMS/#message-type-2","title":"Message Type 2:","text":"Byte 1 (char) Byte 2 (char) Byte 3 (char) Byte 4 (char) Byte 5-6 (char) Byte 7 (char) Byte 8 (char) Byte 9 (char) Byte 10 (char) A Z Source ID (char) Dest ID (char) Message Type (char) X(char) Y(char) B Y"},{"location":"BdPdMS/#message-type-3","title":"Message Type 3:","text":"Byte 1 (char) Byte 2 (char) Byte 3 (char) Byte 4 (char) Byte 5-6 (char) Byte 7-55 (char) Byte 56 (char) Byte 57 (char) A Z Source ID (char) Dest ID (char) Message Type (char) String B Y"},{"location":"BdPdMS/#message-type-4","title":"Message Type 4:","text":"Byte 1 (char) Byte 2 (char) Byte 3 (char) Byte 4 (char) Byte 5-6 (char) Byte 7 (uint8_t) Byte 8 (char) Byte 9 (char) A Z Source ID (char) Dest ID (char) Message Type (char) X(uint8_t) B Y"},{"location":"BdPdMS/#message-type-5","title":"Message Type 5:","text":"Byte 1 (char) Byte 2 (char) Byte 3 (char) Byte 4 (char) Byte 5-6 (char) Byte 7 (char) Byte 8 (char) Byte 9 (char) A Z Source ID (char) Dest ID (char) Message Type (char) X(char) B Y"},{"location":"BdPdMS/#message-type-6","title":"Message Type 6:","text":"Byte 1 (char) Byte 2 (char) Byte 3 (char) Byte 4 (char) Byte 5-6 (char) Byte 7 (uint8_t) Byte 8 (char) Byte 9 (char) A Z Source ID (char) Dest ID (char) Message Type (char) X(uint8_t) B Y"},{"location":"BdPdMS/#message-type-7","title":"Message Type 7:","text":"Byte 1 (char) Byte 2 (char) Byte 3 (char) Byte 4 (char) Byte 5-6 (char) Byte 7 (uint8_t) Byte 8 (char) Byte 9 (char) A Z Source ID (char) Dest ID (char) Message Type (char) X(uint8_t) B Y"},{"location":"BdPdMS/#wifi-status-code-key","title":"Wifi Status Code Key","text":"<p>Connected:     1 Not Connected: 0</p>"},{"location":"IdeationandConcept/","title":"The Exhibit","text":"<p>This exhibit is a way to show young adults that everything, both large or small can have energy.

The goal of the exhibit is to use S.T.E.M. to create an exhibit that will inspire students, ranging from 6th to 12th grade, about S.T.E.M. The concept sketch shows the increase in potential energy stored in objects at higher elevation and how we can use different means to capture that energy and transfer it. What makes it an interactive exhibit is that the user can choose what height level to release the \u201cwater\u201d down the ramp as well as choose the volume of \u201cwater\u201d retreating from our reservoir. How the exhibit functions; first, there are three motors attached to 3 different valves and reservoirs. The motors will open and close the valve to release marbles, \u201cwater\u201d, down the ramp, exiting through another simple motor to collect and distribute energy to a nearby LED. Several buttons will be used so that the user can choose the desired parameters for the exhibit. After parameters are entered and the exhibit is on, an LED screen will display the amount of voltage being produced by the generator, simple motor. When the exhibit is connected to a user\u2019s device, the user will have the same function as the buttons.</p> <p>When designing the device team 202 will attempt to keep it simple in function and aesthetic. Although our target audience are students who are 6th to 12th grade, we would like students below the 6th grade to see the exhibit and understand how to function it as well. To keep it simple, if we have to provide an instruction document on how to operate the exhibit, it will be a single page and straight to the point. We also plan to apply informative art, or text, next to buttons to facilitate smoother operating. Such as, L1, L2, and L3, these variables would be next to the buttons, referring to the different elevations of the exhibit,  as well as labeled again at the elevation it is referring to. The exhibit is operated and only interactive through buttons, our only safety concern is if the buttons to interact with the device are too close to the exit of the marbles. To combat this we may change the exit of the marbles or the placement of the buttons. Regarding durability and comfort, we expect the marbles to produce a minimal amount of destructive force going down the ramp and therefore do not expect durability to play a large role in our exhibit. Because the exhibit is operated through buttons and designed to display information, comfort does not play a role in our exhibit. Once our buttons are labeled, another useful tool to operate the exhibit will be an instruction page. As stated above, the instruction page will be short. The instructions will be a single page with digestible terminology on how to operate the exhibit and the steps will be numbered to limit human error and decide the direction of interaction with the exhibit.</p>"},{"location":"IdeationandConcept/#link-to-presentation","title":"Link to presentation","text":"<p>Powerpoint Presentation</p>"},{"location":"appendix/","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"appendix/#appendix","title":"APPENDIX","text":""},{"location":"appendix/#team-member-schematics","title":"Team Member Schematics","text":"Team Members Schematic Links Tyler Sensor Subsystem (Hall Effect Sensor) Luis Wifi Subsystem Frank Motor Subsystem (Stepper Motor) Alex HMI (Human Machine Interface) Subsystem"},{"location":"appendix/#science-standard","title":"Science Standard","text":"Science Standards Link Cross Concept CC AZ State K-12 Standards K-12 Standards Arizona Science and Engineering Practices AZ Science and Eng Practices"},{"location":"teamOrg/","title":"Team Organization","text":""},{"location":"teamOrg/#roles","title":"Roles","text":"Roles Member Description Submitter/ Lead Luis Saenz Submits assignments, as well as upload to github.
