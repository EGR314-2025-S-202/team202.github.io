## TEAM ORGANIZATION
Here we should have our charter statement followed by some context. 
As technology becomes more advanced STEM is being introduced to students sooner into their education. Although STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and math, these fields aren't independent, but frequently interact with each other.Team 202 is to design and create a mechanical device that showcases some STEM related principle. The device's intention is to inspire students pursuing STEM and enhance their perspective when it comes to STEM.  The team's goal for the device is that it functions autonomously, or until given another task. Our goals as a team is to develop our skills in engineering and robotics allowing us to be better prepared for our chosen profession ahead of us. 

Additionally we should have a **PRODUCT MISSION STATEMENT** followed w/ supportive text. Short written section. "This can easily be done by adding "connective tissue", that explains how the team agreed upon the a project charter and mission statement rather than just pasting them in."
