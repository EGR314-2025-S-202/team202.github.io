## TEAM ORGANIZATION

As technology becomes more advanced S.T.E.M. is being introduced to students sooner into their education. Although S.T.E.M. stands for science, technology, engineering, and math, these fields aren't independent, but frequently interact with each other.Team 202 is to design and create a mechanical device that showcases some S.T.E.M. related principle. *It is team 202 mission to take S.T.E.M concepts found in education and deliver them in a manner students would understand*. The device's intention is to inspire students pursuing S.T.E.M. and enhance their perspective about the fields of S.T.E.M.. 

To achieve our task the team got together to discuss goals for the project. The team's goal for the device is that it functions autonomously, or until given another task. One of our goals as a team is to further develop our skills in engineering and robotics allowing us to be more effective in our chosen profession in the future. The team will assign roles to operate more smoothly, each member will practice effective communication and be accountable for the task they are given.
